<h3>It is an educational platform for IT students.</h1>

It allows you to:
1) Write tests to consolidate the material
2) Write contests to learn the language or reinforce the material you have learned
3) Create study groups and assign roles: teacher, student, guest and own roles.
4) Create your own articles, courses, contests (in the future)

The platform will be actively developed in the future. Now the functionality will be gradually refined and the project will leave the freezing stage.
